# Academic_average_calculator
Academic Average Calculator is a web application designed to assist users in monitoring their academic progress. The site allows users to manage their courses effectively and calculate their average grades. The project's backend is implemented using Python and Flask, with all the backend files organized within the "Model" folder. Additionally, the binary data files are stored in a subfolder named "data" within the "Model" folder.

On the frontend side, the project utilizes HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing and interactive user interface. All the frontend files are structured and stored in the "View" folder.

This logical separation of the backend and frontend components enhances the project's maintainability and enables clear separation of concerns. By adopting this file organization approach, the development process becomes more streamlined, facilitating future updates and enhancements to the application.
